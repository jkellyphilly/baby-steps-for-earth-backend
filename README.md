# README

Welcome to the Baby Steps for Earth backend repo! This serves as a Rails API for the Baby Steps for Earth React application, the repository for which can be found here: https://github.com/jkellyphilly/baby-steps-for-earth.

Taking care of the earth and the environment can feel like a daunting task, so the purpose of this application is to break it down into a series of baby steps. This is just the backend of the application, so follow along to ensure that everything is running properly.

This was built with Ruby v2.6.1.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository down to your local environment, then run 'bundle install' to install all required gems from the Gemfile.

## Usage

This Rails API is the back-end to the Baby Steps for Earth application, found here. To get the application up and working, run `rails s` from your command line and visit localhost:[port-number] (the port number will be specified in your terminal).

To test whether or not this is working, visit a few of the resources, such as plans, goals, or tags. Open up a rails console in another window with `rails c` and create a few resources, ensuring that data appears once it has been created.

For a more thorough explanation of how to use this app (interacting with the front-end), check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd6Rc8FYgyg
